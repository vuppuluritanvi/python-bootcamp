# Python bootcamp

# Introduction 
Hi, I'm Tanvi, an 18-year-old student based in Bangalore, about to take the next step in my journey into the world of code
Join me as I navigate through Dr. Angela Yu's beginner Python course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy. I'll be documenting my progress, the projects I create along the way, and all the mistakes I'll make as I take on this challenge.
Follow along for weekly updates!

# My goals
+ To get into the habit of coding consistently.
+ To reflect on my progress weekly and fix any mistakes I make.
+ To understand key programming concepts.
+ To build at least one personal project by the end of the course.
